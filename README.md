# JKRentals
Xamarin Forms (iOS &amp; Android) app for quick 'n easy apartment rental application, created for JK Rentals, Inc - an apartment company based in Centerville, OH.

## Why?
Previously, apartment rentals involved filling out a long sheet of paper. In order to process this information, landlords also needed a lot of time to review this information and get back to the potential tenants.

By offering a mobile application and entering experience, we're making it even easier to fill out your application and send to a landlord for faster review. 

## Planned features for v1 (tentative) - to be released August 2020
1. Faster application entry on mobile
2. Application info stored on device for later use
3. Quicker email to landlord (w/ encryption to protect sensitive data)

## Long Term Goals
1. **Expansion to more rental companies** - At the moment, this app is for JK Rentals only. I'd like to be able to expand this app so that all rental companies can use it.
2. **Advanced communication features** - Add features to facilitate communication between tenant and landlord (messages, rent payments, etc.)
3. **User accounts** - to help store information easier.
4. More info to be decided later.
